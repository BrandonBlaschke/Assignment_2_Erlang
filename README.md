# Assignment_2_Erlang
Assignment 2 for a Erlang project

Project was to read in expressions like ((5+5)*4) and evaluate them reading one character at a time. 
Implemented the Shunting algorithm to add operator order to the parsing. It takes in the expression, creates the postfix stack, and 
then converts it into infix that the parser can then read.
